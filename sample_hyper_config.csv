# Similar to testing arguments, a line staring with hash tag (#) is a comment

# Empty lines are ignored

# The hyper parameter tuning is based on grid search currently. So, each combination is going to be tested

# Sample configs for both learning rate and momentum

# lr means the learning rate changing rate, not the actual value, i.e., lr=0.1 means 10 times less than original lr
lr: 10, 0.1, 1

# momentum is the actual value, i.e., momentum=0.9 is literally momentum=0.9
momentum: 0.9, 0.85
